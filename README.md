Add save and close button to TYPO3 backend content editing.

## What does it do?

Adds save and close button beside the save button.

# Credits

This repository is just a fork of the existing repository https://github.com/avionbg/save_close_ce/.
As there is no further progress of releasing a v11 ready version I did it here.
Changed the vendor to spooner-web to release it on packagist.

**All credits go to the coders and contributors of the original version**
